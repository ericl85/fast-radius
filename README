An attempt at an extendable non-blocking RADIUS server. This is more of a Node.js experiment as it is my first Node project and I thought I'd do something that (a) solves a problem for me and (b) is a domain I'm familiar with. 

There is absolutely nothing useful in this project as of yet. So... nothing to see here.
